# Disaster Response Pipeline Project

## Udacity Data Scientist Nanodegree

### Description of the Project:
This Project is a part of Data Science Nanodegree Program by Udacity. The goal of the project is to develop a machine learning pipeline that predict the category of incomming messages related to disaster response. The training dataset is a prelabelled set of messages provided in two files `disaster_messages.csv` (for the messages) and `disaster_categories.csv` (for the labels). A data dashboard is also developed so that the user can input new messages and finds out the corresponding category of the message. 

### Project Structure 

The Project is divided into the following Sections:

1. Data Processing: Data processing is performed in the file `ETL Pipeline Preparation.ipynb` and  ETL Pipeline to extract data from source, clean data and save them in a proper databse structure.
2. Machine Learning Pipeline to train a model which is able to classify text messages in 36 categories.
3. Web Application using Flask to show model results and predictions in real time.

### Data:

The data in this project comes from Figure Eight - Multilingual Disaster Response Messages. This dataset contains 30,000 messages drawn from events including an earthquake in Haiti in 2010, an earthquake in Chile in 2010, floods in Pakistan in 2010, super-storm Sandy in the U.S.A. in 2012, and news articles spanning a large number of years and 100s of different disasters.

The data has been encoded with 36 different categories related to disaster response and has been stripped of messages with sensitive information in their entirety.

Data includes 2 csv files:

1. disaster_messages.csv: Messages data.
2. disaster_categories.csv: Disaster categories of messages.

### Instructions:

1. Clone this repository

```
git clone git@github.com:prateeksawhney97/Disaster-Response-Pipeline.git
```

2. Run the following commands in the project's root directory to set up your database and model.

    - To run ETL pipeline that cleans data and stores in database
        `python data/process_data.py data/disaster_messages.csv data/disaster_categories.csv data/Disaster_Response.db`
    - To run ML pipeline that trains classifier and saves
        `python models/train_classifier.py data/Disaster_Response.db models/classifier.pkl`

3. Run the following command in the app's directory to run your web app.
    `python run.py`

4. Go to http://0.0.0.0:3001/
